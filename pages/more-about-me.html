          Coding is fun and hard work. It's most satisfying when the project is
          complete and you can see the result.

          When I'm not coding I like to enjoy boba tea or boba coffee. I also
          like to sew as a way to calm and distract myself. It helps me to code
          as well. After a distraction, I am able to go back to coding with
          fresh eyes.
